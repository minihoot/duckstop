<h1>About:</h1>
<p>Duckstop is what I'd call a remote desktop protocol of it's own, written in Python. It has a very functional web client.
This project was originally going to be a simple little project but I have expanded on it and with the help of LeGamermc I was able to get most of the inputs working. </p>
